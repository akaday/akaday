In the Heart of the Storm
![Uploading Capture d'√©cran 2024-11-21 212706.png‚Ä¶]()

Beneath the wail of the wind's fierce cry, Where angry waves kiss the midnight sky, In the heart of the storm, where fears abide, Brave souls venture, their courage our guide.

The sea roars wild, a relentless beast, With whitecaps frothing, never ceasing feast. Yet in the darkness, a light does gleam, From vessels strong, driven by a dream.

Through torrents thick and thunder‚Äôs clap, They chart their course on nature‚Äôs map. With hearts of steel and eyes aglow, They search the depths for souls below.

Whispers of hope in the tempest's breath, Rescue's call defies the dance of death. In lifeboats sturdy, with hands held tight, They brave the maw of the endless night.

For every life they fight to save, Against the ocean‚Äôs mighty wave, They bring a spark, a beacon bright, Guiding lost souls back to the light.
